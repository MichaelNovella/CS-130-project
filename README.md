# CS-130-project

130 gomoku project

The way to install this is by launching xampp, start up apache and php, setting up a user named AdminLab12 in your database with the needed credentials and going to index.html. From this, you can either sign in or sign up for a game and after you do either you can play the game of gomoku. After one of the players wins, the page will load in the leaderboard for the current signed in user. This leaderboard will display the best players, sort players by ascending/descending order of won games, time played, number of games played and display all the games played by the player who is logged into the system.
