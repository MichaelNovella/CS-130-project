                <p>This is a basic game of gomoku.</p>
                <h2>Win Conditions and play</h2>
                <p>The main way to win is to get five of your colored tiles in a row in one of eight directions. This is achieved by placing one of your pieces on the grid and lining them up.</p>
                <h2>Buttons</h2>
                <p>Around the playing square are different buttons that can be pushed to give a new board of varying size, a hint on where to place a piece, and a way to change the color scheme for the whole board.</p>
                <h2>Two textboxes</h2>
                <p>the two textboxes at the bottom are there for helping finding the hints.</p>
